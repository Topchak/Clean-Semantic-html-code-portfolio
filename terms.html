                    withdrawal request was paid out, provided all other conditions are met and checks are completed, as
                    outlined in the Terms. Financial department agents process requests for withdrawing monetary funds
                    from 6 AM to 5 PM GMT, Monday-Friday. You consent that you are familiar and agree with the timetable
                    of withdrawing funds. After the financial department has worked through the request to transfer
                    funds,
                    any further delays in processing payments are not the Company’s responsibility.</p>
                  <p><span>6.16</span> The Company may delay processing of your withdrawal request to perform checks of
                    your identity, account balance, source of funds and of your compliance with the Terms. In such
                    cases,
                    the Company may start and/or take part in and/or help in the investigation of the circumstances and
                    you agree to provide support and assistance in any such investigation. The Company reserves the

                    to postpone performing any payments or providing the sum of the winnings until all verification
                    procedures and checks outlined in the Terms are successfully completed.</p>
                  <p><span>6.17</span> The Company keeps customer funds separate from its own funds in dedicated client
                    bank accounts. This set-up ensures that funds held in customers` accounts are kept secure in case of
                    insolvency. Consequently, in the event of our insolvency, your funds are protected and shall be
                    returned to you.</p>

                    (five) as an administration fee while the Account remains Inactive. We have the right to change the
                    monthly administrative fee on our own discretion without notice. If the Account balance is less than
                    EUR 5 (five), the entire amount will be charged. When the balance reaches zero, no more

                    undertakes to refund all amounts incorrectly written off or not accrued due to technical problems to
                    customers' accounts during 30 (thirty) days from the time such failure has been detected.</p>
                  <p><span>6.20</span> In case the Company has mistakenly (due to a technical error in the winnings

                    with funds that do not belong to him, then this amount will be considered the property of the
                    Company
                    and will be deducted from the customer’s account. If a customer withdraws funds that do not belong
                    to
                    him before the error was noticed, then the mistakenly paid amount (without prejudice to the legal
                    means and actions of the customer) will be considered as a customer's debt to the Company. In the
                    event of an inaccurate replenishment of the balance, the customer must immediately notify the
                    Company
                    via e-mail.</p>

                    (depending
                    on the terms of the promotion in question). By way of example, a wagering requirement of x5 (five)
                    means that you
                    must bet the equivalent of five times the respective amount. Wagering requirements applicable to

                      general public, and you have no direct or indirect influence whatsoever on the outcome of the
                      Event.</p>
                    <p><span>16.1.4 &nbsp;</span>In case we have a reasonable suspicion of dishonesty in the course of
                      the Event, or of unfairness in the outcome of the Event, we reserve the right to void the bets
                      made on such Event and to refund the original stake amount.</p>

                      employees or computer software (mistakes in odds and others) and other reasons causing incorrect
                      bets or odds.</p>
                    <p><span>16.1.6&nbsp;</span>The customer is fully responsible for all bets placed on the Website
                      through the customer's account. We do not cancel or void any bets based on the grounds that the
                      customer does not have an understanding of the markets or the Event.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2&nbsp;</span>Terms and Conditions for Accepting bets</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.1&nbsp;</span>Bets are accepted based on the daily "odds line", which is a list of
                      upcoming matches with odds and handicaps offered by the Company on outcomes of Events.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.2&nbsp;</span>The odds and handicaps take into account the strength correlation of the
                      competing teams or players and determine the value of the expected winnings of the person placing
                      the bet.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.3&nbsp;</span>The Company has the right to change the odds and handicaps at any time.
                      The terms of the bets placed before the change are not affected by the change. The Company has the
                      right to remove any Event from the offered "line".</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.4&nbsp;</span>The customer places a bet according to the "line" operating at the time
                      of the bet</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.5&nbsp;</span>The customer chooses the number of the event and outcomes of the
                      competition from the predictions offered by the Company.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.6&nbsp;</span>The customer must state the amount of each bet and receive a bet
                      confirmation when the bet is placed.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.7&nbsp;</span>After placing a bet with the Company, it cannot be canceled or changed.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>16.2.8&nbsp;</span>Once determined, the outcome of an Event is settled. All played Events —
                      pre-match and live Events - are paid according to the official result and after that are
                      considered closed.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.9&nbsp;</span>Events not started on time for any reason or even postponed may be kept
                      open and all bets remain valid if those kick off (start) within the next 48 (forty-eight) hours
                      from the official start time. In any other case, the Company reserves the right to void all bets
                      of such postponed Events and refund the stakes to the customers at its own discretion.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.10&nbsp;</span>The Company reserves the right to keep all bets valid and settle them
                      according to the result for Events abandoned after start time and continued by the organizer
                      within 48 (forty-eight) hours from the official start time.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.11&nbsp;</span>As for Events abandoned after the start time and not continued by the
                      organizer within 48 (forty-eight) hours, the Company will settle all determined markets decided
                      before the Event was abandoned and void the rest by refunding stakes to customers. However, in
                      cases like that the Company reserves the right to void all bets of such abandoned Events and
                      refund all the stakes to the customers at its own discretion.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.12&nbsp;</span>From general rule above, there are exceptions as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>&nbsp;Tennis games will be kept open with all bets valid until the officials or organizing
                        body declares a winner. In such cases, the 48 hours rule is not valid. However, and in case of a
                        player retirement, or default (injury,Illness, or personal circumstance), adult decision,
                        walkover, disqualification or abandonment, all markets determined in the pitch are settled
                        accordingly and all the rest undecided declared void and null. For avoidance of doubt, if a
                        tennis player retired before the last point concluded, the match winner market is void, but all
                        market related to specific sets or games that are determined, are settled accordingly. Markets
                        that have been mathematically reached will be settled after the deciding point has been
                        confirmed.</li>
                      <p>&nbsp;Example: at the set score of 3-3, the minimum number of games for the set to be completed
                        is 9 (either 6-3 or 3-6). This means that total lines of 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5 can already be settled
                        as a win for Over. Integer lines where neither selection wins will be voided.</p>
                      <li>&nbsp;Baseball games when two teams are playing 2 (two) games in a row are considered as Game
                        1 and Game 2 and will be settled as chronologically played with all bets valid. For avoidance of
                        doubt if Team A plays vs Team B twice, the result of Game 1 will count for bets offered on Game
                        1 as originally scheduled and result of Game 2 will count for bets offered on Game 2, as
                        originally scheduled. Matches will be cancelled if they are not going to be played the same day
                        (local). For example, if they play 24 (twenty-four) hours later, a new match ID will be created,
                        since usually there is a doubleheader and changed starting pitchers. If the start time changes,
                        it is updated as soon as official information is out.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span>16.2.13&nbsp;</span>If the bets are settled according to the actual result of an Event as
                      per the official announcement, then any change due to protest, doping etc. after 24 (twenty-four)
                      hours or later occurs, such change is not taken into consideration and all bets will be paid
                      according to the initial official announcement. If such change occurs before 24 (twenty-four)
                      hours have elapsed, results of all bets will be recalculated according to such change.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.14&nbsp;</span>The Company reserves the right not to accept all or part of a bet
                      without providing a reason to the customer. If a bet is not accepted, customer’s stakes are
                      refunded.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.15&nbsp;</span>Before an Event starts, the Company reserves, at its own discretion,
                      the right to void or cancel part of or the full bet even after its acceptance without providing
                      any reason to the customer.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.16&nbsp;</span>After the Event starts, the Company reserves, at its own discretion,
                      the right to void or cancel part or whole of a bet even after its acceptance, in case there is a
                      valid reason for this, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>&nbsp;mistake in the wording (semantic error) of the event or the odds, or starting time;</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;the customer attempts to bypass Company limits (potential payout) and risk management by
                        placing multiple identical or similar bets or opening multiple accounts;</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;the customer is getting the advantage of any public announcement or secret information
                        he has access to that determines the outcome of the Event;</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;the customer combined related bets;</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;the customer is actively participating in the Event, such as players, referees,
                        managers, or is in direct or indirect relationship with events participants or has a direct or
                        indirect influence on the Event result;</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;the Company suffers a technical error offering wrong odds or Events;</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;any other reason communicated to the customer upon request.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span>16.2.17&nbsp;</span>Several identical bets may be considered as one in case the customer
                      made a number of mirror bets.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.18&nbsp;</span>Information displayed during live Events (including the update of this
                      information) is informative only. A wrong result is no reason to refund the wager. The Company
                      accepts no responsibility for incorrect results during the live Event.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.19&nbsp;</span>The Company is not responsible for incorrect spelling of surnames, team
                      names and names of places for the Event.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.20&nbsp;</span>Calculation of the bets is done by the Company. The Event results
                      announced by the Company are the basis for calculating the wagers and determining the winnings.
                      The Company is not obliged to follow the official result if there is suspicion of semantic or
                      typing error proved by the real action of the event</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.21&nbsp;</span>The results of sporting Events announced in the periodical press may
                      not be grounds for submitting players' claims against the Company.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.22&nbsp;</span>In disputed situations the final decision is made by the Company,
                      taking into account practice of the bookmaking business and customers’ interests.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.23&nbsp;</span>The Company has the right to limit the maximum bet for individual
                      Events and also to limit or raise the maximum bet for specific persons without giving an
                      explanation.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.24&nbsp;</span>The Company reserves the right to cancel the bonus and to refuse to
                      provide it to the client in case of suspicion of violation of the fairness of the game or the use
                      of malicious strategies. Moreover, the Company reserves the right to refuse to provide a bonus to
                      the client without giving reasons and prior notification. In case of a dispute situation, the
                      decision of the Company is considered final and is not negotiable.</p>
                    <p><span>16.2.25&nbsp;</span>If the customer starts using the credited bonus money in the sports
                      section, wagering requirements still must be met, despite the bonus has been expired or canceled
                      automatically/by the customer.</p>
                    <p><span>16.3&nbsp;</span>Rollover rules for sports betting</p>

                      from the free bet, that was credited to his account, at least 3 (three) times on either single or
                      multibet. Any bets made on Events with odds less than 1.5 (one and five tenths), will not be
                      counted in the wagering of the winnings.</p>
                    <p><span>16.3.2&nbsp;</span>Only bets which are settled as won or lost are counted towards any type
                      of rollover requirements.</p>

                      completed within 48 (forty-eight) hours or as prescribed in the specific sports rules, then all
                      bets will be void, except for those on markets that have been unconditionally determined. Reasons

                        and all the rest declared void and null. For the avoidance of doubt if a tennis player retired
                        before the last point concluded, the match winner market is void,but all markets related to
                        specific sets or games that determined, are settled accordingly.</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;Baseball games when two teams are playing 2 (two) games in a row are considered as Game
                        1 and Game 2 and will be settled as chronologically played with all bets valid. For avoidance of
                        doubt if Team A plays vs Team B twice, the result of Game 1 will count for bets offered on Game
                        1 as originally scheduled and result of Game 2 will count for bets offered on Game 2, as
                        originally scheduled. Matches will be cancelled if they are not going to be played the same day
                        (local).</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;For example if they play 24 (twenty-four) hours later, a new match ID will be created,
                        since usually there is a doubleheader and changed starting pitchers.</li>
                      <li>&nbsp;If the start time changes, it is updated as soon as official information is out.</li>

                    <p><span>16.5.1&nbsp;</span>Unless otherwise stated, if a match is scheduled to be played on neutral
                      ground but is played on non-neutral ground or vice versa, all bets will still be considered valid.
                      In the event of a change of venue where home team plays away or vice versa, all bets on the match
                      will be considered void. Bets will also be considered void if the home and away team names are
                      wrongly stated in reverse. As a general rule the first team listed is the 'Home' team unless
                      otherwise stated.</p>
                    <p><span>16.5.2&nbsp;</span>For all non-team Events, if the scheduled venue is changed after the
                      market has been opened, then all bets will still be considered valid except where stated within
                      the individual sport rules.</p>
                    <p><span>16.6&nbsp;</span>Periods of Time</p>
                    <p><span>16.6.1&nbsp;</span>The posted duration of an Event is for reference purposes only. Bets
                      will be valid despite the change in scheduled duration except where stated within the individual
                      sport rules.</p>
                    <p><span>16.6.2&nbsp;</span>Any incident during injury or stoppage time that is played, is deemed to
                      have occurred at the end of regular time, e.g. a goal scored in first half injury time of a soccer
                      match is deemed to have been scored on 45 (forty-five) minutes.</p>
                    <p><span>16.6.3&nbsp;</span>In the case of the general implied rules of a sport being violated, we
                      reserve the right to void any market (e.g. unusual period length, counting procedure, format of a
                      match etc.).</p>
                    <p><span>16.6.4&nbsp;</span>In the case of the rules or format of a match differing from our implied
                      information, we reserve the right to void any market.</p>
                    <p><span>16.6.5&nbsp;</span>Unless otherwise stated, all bets are settled on the result of regular
                      time.</p>
                    <p><span>16.6.6&nbsp;</span>Settlement for markets containing a time interval will be as follows.
                      The first interval is considered as 00:01 until the start of the minute indicated as the end. For
                      the avoidance of doubt, the interval 1-15 (one – fifteen) mins is considered the period 00:01 to
                      15:00.</p>
                    <p><span>16.6.7&nbsp;</span>The last interval is considered as from the minute indicated until the
                      end of the period as decided by the referee. For example in Soccer, the interval 30-45 (thirty –
                      forty-five) minutes is considered as 30:01 to the end of the First Half. The interval 75-90
                      (seventy-five – ninety) minutes is considered the period from 75:01 until the end of regular time.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>16.6.8&nbsp;</span>Bets placed on Player Statistics (player passes, player tackles, player
                      total cards, player assists, player shots/shots on target) will be settled according to the
                      official statistics of the game (including extra time if there is any). If the listed player is
                      not in the starting lineup of the match, the bets will be settled as void.</p>
                    <p><span>16.7&nbsp;</span>Results</p>
                    <p><span>16.7.1&nbsp;</span>Where relevant, podium positions will count as the official result,
                      regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the results. If there is no podium
                      ceremony, results will be determined in accordance with the official result of the relevant
                      governing body at the time of the market settlement, regardless of any subsequent disqualification
                      or amendment to the results. If no official result is available then the result will be determined
                      with reference to the available evidence known at the time of market settlement and the decision
                      of the Company is final.</p>
                    <p><span>16.7.2&nbsp;</span>Markets are generally settled shortly after the conclusion of an Event.
                      Purely as a customer service, some markets may be settled before the official result is declared.
                      The Company reserves the right to reverse settlement in the Event of a market being settled in
                      error and this will be reflected in your balance.</p>
                    <p><span>16.7.3&nbsp;</span>In the Event of uncertainty over any result then the Company reserves
                      the right to suspend settlement of any market. If the outcome of a market cannot be verified
                      officially, we reserve the right to void them or delay the settlement until official confirmation.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>16.7.4&nbsp;</span>In the case of an incorrect settlement of markets, we reserve the right
                      to correct them anytime.</p>
                    <p><span>16.7.5&nbsp;</span>Where there is a conflict between the official results and the results
                      posted on the results section of the Company’s Website, the conflict shall be resolved by
                      reference to the Company's video recording of the particular Event to determine the correct
                      result. However, if no such video recording is available, then the correct result shall be
                      determined in accordance with the result of the particular Event’s relevant governing body as
                      published on its official website. If the official website is unable to provide the result or
                      official website's posted result is manifestly wrong, then the Company reserves the right to make
                      decisions/ amendments to determine the final result. The Company’s decision is final and binding
                      in this regard, however we will give our justification for the result upon request. This may
                      include video evidence.</p>
                    <p><span>16.7.6&nbsp;</span>In the case of any obviously incorrectly displayed or calculated prices,
                      we reserve the right to void betting. This includes a deviation of more than 100% in the pay-out
                      compared to the market average. Any bet inadvertently accepted after an event has finished will be
                      void.</p>
                    <p><span>16.7.7&nbsp;</span>Unless a specific reference is made in the individual section that
                      covers the sport, settlement of all markets will be based on the official competition rules.</p>
                    <p><span>16.7.8&nbsp;</span>Unless a specific reference is made in the individual section that
                      covers the sport, opponents must start the match for ‘head to head’ match bets to stand.</p>
                    <p><span>16.7.9&nbsp;</span>When no price is quoted for a tie and the official competition rules do
                      not determine a clear winner or the official result is a tie, dead heat rules will apply. In a
                      ‘Dead Heat’ the stake money on a selection is divided by the number of runners involved in the
                      dead heat. The full odds are then paid to the divided stake, with the remainder of the stake money
                      being lost.</p>
                    <p><span>16.7.10&nbsp;</span>Where bets are available on whether a specific number is odd or even,
                      Zero will count as even and unless otherwise stated (in the market or in the individual sport
                      rules) extra time, overtime and extra innings will not count</p>
                    <p><span>16.7.11&nbsp;</span>Where there is no action in an event after a bet has been placed the
                      bet will be void.</p>

                    <p><span>16.8.1&nbsp;</span>Bets placed during an Event (‘Live Betting’) will almost certainly be
                      subject to a delay, which will vary by sport and competition.</p>
                    <p><span>16.8.2&nbsp;</span>If any of the disruptions mentioned in this Section happen before the
                      countdown timer ends, all bets placed using Timer Acceptance are immediately void:</p>
                    <ul>

                      <li>&nbsp;Fortuitous events including, but not limited to, failure in any equipment or
                        telecommunication that prevents the correct placing, accepting, recording or notification of
                        bets, delays or interruptions in operation or transmission, communication lines failure.</li>

                      the Customer acknowledges that the current score, time elapsed and other data provided on this
                      site (including ‘Live’ TV pictures) while coming from a “live” feed provided by a third party is
                      subject to a time delay and/or may be inaccurate, and that any bet placed based on this data is
                      entirely at the customer’s own risk. The Company provides this data and accepts no responsibility
                      for any loss (direct or indirect) suffered by the customer as a result of his reliance on it.</p>

                    <p><span>16.9.1&nbsp;</span>Maximum bet limits vary from sport to sport and from game to game.</p>
                    <p><span>16.9.2&nbsp;</span>Minimum bet per event is 0.5 (five tenths) in the currency of the

                    <p><span>16.9.3&nbsp;</span>A bet is accepted on the basis that it is the investment of one customer
                      only.</p>
                    <p><span>16.9.4&nbsp;</span>The maximum amount that can be won (excluding stake) by one customer in
                      one days betting regardless of stake is 100 000 (one hundred thousand) EUR or equivalent in your
                      account currency. Where bets have been placed on different days, the maximum amount that can be
                      won in one day’s betting is determined by the day on which the final event on each bet is
                      resolved, rather than the day on which each individual bet is placed.</p>
                    <p><span>16.9.5&nbsp;</span>The maximum numbers of selections in multi-bets and system bets is 30
                      (thirty) selections.</p>

                      a free bet bonus) is x3 (three) of the initial amount of the received no deposit bonus. The rest
                      of the winnings that exceed this amount will be deducted by the Company.</p>
                    <p><span>16.9.7&nbsp;</span>In order to be able to request a withdrawal, the minimal wager of the
                      free bet winnings has to be x3 (three). The customer has to roll over the amount of his winnings
                      from the free bet, that was credited to his account, at least 3 (three) times on either single or
                      multibet. Any bets made on Events with odds less than 1.5 (one and five tenths), will not be
                      counted in the wagering of the winnings. Only bets which are settled as won or lost are counted
                      towards any type of rollover requirements.</p>
                    <p><span>16.10&nbsp;</span>Time of Acceptance</p>
                    <p><span>16.10.1&nbsp;</span>If, for any reason, a bet is inadvertently accepted after the event or

                      Event in question is covered by our ‘in running’ or Live service.</p>
                    <p><span>16.10.2&nbsp;</span>We reserve the right to amend obvious errors, and accept bets after an

                      resolved or at a stage where the client could have had any indication of the outcome we reserve
                      the right to void that selection.</p>
                    <p><span>16.10.3&nbsp;</span>In the event of there being a dispute over the time at which a bet was

                    <p><span>16.11.1&nbsp;</span>Live or in-running betting is, by nature, subject to large and sudden
                      changes in odds as the Event unfolds. For this reason, we cannot guarantee that prices will always
                      be available, and reserve the right not to offer odds throughout the entire match at our absolute
                      discretion.</p>
                    <p><span>16.11.2&nbsp;</span>In addition, we reserve the right to refuse or void bets, even when
                      prices are displayed on our website, if due to circumstances outside of our control the prices
                      shown are wide of the industry market price at the time the bet is placed. Our decision regarding
                      this is final.</p>
                    <p><span>16.11.3&nbsp;</span>If coverage has to be abandoned and the match finishes regularly, all

                    <p><span>16.12.4&nbsp;</span>If there are two or more winners, or a “dead heat” is declared in any
                      outright market then your stake is divided by the number of winners, and this new amount is then
                      settled at the full odds (not including the stake). For example, if there are multiple winners of
                      the English Premier League Top Goalscorer market. In our example two players were declared as
                      winners. Your bet of 1,000 (one thousand) on Sergio Agüero (one of the winners) at odds of 3.50
                      (three and five tenths) would be settled as follows: (1,000/2) x 3.50. 500 x 3.50 = 1,750 returns.

                    <p><span>16.12.6&nbsp;</span>The term “others on request” refers to any unquoted player, team or
                      score etc. Should you require a price for a selection not named in the market please contact our
                      customer service and we will add in the selections you request. In all instances we will attempt
                      to offer all obvious outcomes. For markets that refer to ‘Others on Request’ where a selection not
                      named is the Winner. All bets would be settled as losers.</p>

                    <p><span>16.13.1&nbsp;</span>Moneyline means betting on one competitor or team to defeat another in

                      head start (effectively leading by that head start before the Event begins). The winner is the
                      competitor or team with the better score after adding the given handicap to the result. For both
                      totals and sides betting all stakes are returned when the final score falls on the handicap line
                      (in America termed as a 'push'). Remaining Handicap rules are set out in the specific Sport
                      Betting Rules.</p>
                    <p><span>16.14.2&nbsp;</span>First Half Handicap means betting on the team with the better score
                      after adding the given handicap to the result of the first half of an Event.</p>
                    <p><span>16.15&nbsp;</span>Over/Under and First Half Over/Under</p>
                    <p><span>16.15.1&nbsp;</span>Over/under means betting that is determined by the total number of
                      points (or goals, games etc.) in the final result of an Event. If the total is more than the
                      Over/under pre-designated line then the winning result is Over; if the total is less than the
                      Over/Under pre-designated line then the winning result is Under.</p>
                    <p><span>16.15.2&nbsp;</span>First half over/under means betting that is determined by the total
                      number of points in the result of the first half of an Event. If the total is more than the
                      over/under pre-designated line then the winning result is Over; if the total is less than the
                      over/under pre-designated line then the winning result is Under.</p>
                    <p><span>16.16&nbsp;</span>Odd/Even, First Half Odd/Even, Single Team Odd/Even</p>
                    <p><span>16.16.1&nbsp;</span>Odd/even means betting that is determined by whether the total number
                      of points (or goals, games etc.) in the final result of an event is odd or even. For all odd/even
                      markets zero is counted as even for settlement purposes.</p>
                    <p><span>16.16.2&nbsp;</span>First half odd/even means betting that is determined by whether the
                      total number of points at the end of the first half of an Event is Odd or Even.</p>
                    <p><span>16.16.3&nbsp;</span>First half bets will be void if an Event is abandoned before the end of
                      the first half. But if an Event is abandoned after the end of the first half, all First half bets
                      will be valid.</p>
                    <p><span>16.16.4&nbsp;</span>Single team odd/even means betting to predict whether the full-time
                      score of a specific team in a match will be odd or even.</p>
                    <p><span>16.16.5&nbsp;</span>Any extra-time or overtime added in the match will not be counted for
                      purposes of determining the full-time score except where stated either in the market or the
                      individual sport rules.</p>
                    <p><span>16.17&nbsp;</span>Multiple Bets/Parlays</p>
                    <p><span>16.17.1&nbsp;</span>Multiple bets (or parlay) means bets in a combination of two or more
                      selections placed as one wager. If all selections should win then the Multiple wins and will be
                      paid at the combined odds of all selections. If one (or more) selections should fail to win then
                      the multiple loses. If one (or more) selections should be postponed or void for any reason, then
                      the odds for that selection will revert to 1.00 (one) odds.</p>
                    <p><span>16.17.2&nbsp;</span>During a match or Event (in play) if any part of the bet is rejected
                      the whole multiple will be rejected. In play Events and pre-match events may be included in the
                      same multiple.</p>
                    <p><span>16.17.3&nbsp;</span>Multiple bets are not accepted where the outcome of one part of the bet
                      contributes to the outcome of another. E.g. No goalscorer and 0-0 correct score in the same match.
                      Our system should reject such bets but if taken in error the stakes will be equally divided as
                      single bets. If you are unsure if your bet is related please check with customer service prior to
                      placing your wager. The decision of the Company as to whether selections are related will be
                      final.</p>
                    <p><span>16.18&nbsp;</span>Cash-Out</p>
                    <p><span>16.18.1&nbsp;</span>The Company offers the option of Cash-Out before an event or market is
                      finalised. If the Cash-Out request is successful, this will be displayed and the bet will be
                      settled immediately. The actual final result of the related market will have no impact on the Cash
                      Out amount. The Cash Out amount offered at any time is the total amount that will be returned to
                      your account if accepted. If a bet is placed with the intention of using Cash-Out, the Company
                      cannot guarantee that the Cash-Out feature will be always available. The Company reserves the
                      right to reverse the settlement of a Cash Out if the bet, or a market is settled in error in
                      addition to correcting obvious errors.</p>

                      case of any delay (rain, darkness etc.) all markets will remain unsettled and the trading will
                      be continued as soon as the match continues.</p>
                    <p><span>17.1.2&nbsp;</span>If a match does not start on the scheduled start date, or within 48

                      minutes of the match has been completed (Pro and College Football). Bets will also be considered
                      valid if an official result is declared by the relevant governing body. Otherwise bets on
                      suspended or abandoned matches will be void, except for those on markets which have been

                    <p><span>17.2.6&nbsp;</span>If a team retires all undecided markets are considered void.</p>

                    <p><span>17.3.1&nbsp;</span>All full-time markets, including Live Betting, will be settled on the
                      final result NOT including extra innings except for ‘Who score the Xth point (run) and ‘Which
                      Team will win race to X points’ or otherwise stated. In Japanese or Korean baseball a tie can be
                      declared and in this case moneyline bets will be refunded.</p>
                    <p><span>17.3.2&nbsp;</span>If a game does not start on the scheduled start date (or within 12
                      (twelve) hours of the scheduled start time) then all bets will be void (unless stated
                      otherwise). If a game is postponed or cancelled before its due start time, all bets are deemed
                      No Action.</p>
                    <p><span>17.3.3&nbsp;</span>For baseball bets to be considered valid then the game must go nine
                      innings (or 8.5 (eight and five tenths) innings if the home team is leading). If a game is
                      ‘called’ or suspended and completed on a subsequent day then all bets (except those which have
                      been unconditionally determined) will be considered void. Specifically for MLB, if a game is
                      ‘called’, or suspended, the winner is determined by the score after the last full inning (unless
                      the home team scores to tie, or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning, in which case
                      the winner is determined by the score at the time the game is called.) Stakes will be refunded
                      if the home team ties the game and it is then suspended. If a game is ‘called’, or suspended,
                      winners and losers for betting (including Totals) are official after at least 5 (five) innings
                      of play unless the home team is leading after 4.5 (four and five tenths) innings. Other markets
                      will be void unless a winning market has already been established.</p>
                    <p><span>17.3.4&nbsp;</span>If a game is suspended or called in extra innings then the score will
                      be determined after the last full inning, unless the home team scores to tie or lead in the
                      bottom half of the inning, in which case the score is determined at the time the game is called.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>17.3.5&nbsp;</span>First 5 (five) innings bets are settled on the result at the end of
                      five innings. If five innings are not completed, for whatever reason, then all bets will be
                      considered void.</p>
                    <p><span>17.3.6&nbsp;</span>World Baseball Classic games can end early if a team is leading by ten
                      or more runs after the opposing team has batted in at least seven innings or if a team is
                      leading by more than fifteen runs after the opposing team has batted in at least five innings.
                      Should this happen then all bets will be considered valid.</p>
                    <p><span>17.3.7&nbsp;</span>International Baseball games (e.g. Olympic matches) may be called
                      early and for bets to be valid, 6.5 (six and five tenths) innings must have been completed.</p>

                      (forty-three) minutes of an NBA match, or 35 (thirty-five) minutes of any other basketball match
                      have been completed. Bets will also be considered valid if an official result is declared by the
                      relevant governing body. Otherwise bets on suspended or abandoned matches will be void, except
                      for those on markets which have been unconditionally determined.</p>
