            <ol>
              <li>
                Log in to your Fat Pirate Casino account and head to the Bingo
                section.

              </li>
              <li>
                Buy one or more Bingo tickets — each ticket displays a grid
                filled with random numbers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once the game starts, numbers will be drawn and displayed
                automatically.
              </li>
              <li>
                The System will auto-mark your numbers, or you can do it

              </li>
              <li>
                Win by completing a winning pattern, such as a full line,

            <h2>Classic Bingo Vibes With a Modern Twist</h2>
            <p>
              While Fat Pirate Bingo features lively animations and quirky
              themes, it stays true to the spirit of traditional Bingo —
              simple rules, fast-paced fun, and the satisfying rush of
              watching numbers fall into place. For players who enjoy a
              nostalgic twist on gameplay, Fat Pirate offers several
              Bingo-style games that stick closely to classic mechanics while
              adding a splash of character and colour. Here’s a step-by-step
              guide to how classic-style Bingo plays out:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Buy Your Bingo Card</strong>: Choose your game and
                purchase one or more Bingo cards, each featuring a 5x5 grid
                filled with numbers. The centre square is usually a free
                space, just like in old-school halls.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Watch the Draw Unfold</strong>: Numbers are pulled
                using a certified Random Number Generator (RNG), ensuring
                every Draw is fair and unpredictable. Numbers appear in
                real-time during the game.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark Your Numbers</strong>: Matching numbers are
                automatically marked as they’re drawn, so you can sit back and
                enjoy the action without missing a beat.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Complete the Pattern</strong>: The aim is to complete
                a designated winning pattern, such as a full horizontal line,
                diagonal, four corners, or the coveted full house. The
                required pattern is displayed at the start of each game.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Let the System Do the Work</strong>: No need to
                manually shout "Bingo!" — if you land the winning combo first,
                the system recognises your victory instantly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Collect Your Winnings</strong>: Winning cards award
                real-money prizes based on your stake and the game’s prize
                structure. Higher stakes usually mean bigger rewards.
              </li>
