              Pirate Casino enforces strict withdrawal policies for all
              players. Whether you’re withdrawing to a bank card, crypto
              wallet, or digital payment service, here are the essential rules
              you must follow:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>KYC Verification Required</strong>: Before processing
                any withdrawal, players must complete the Know Your Customer
                (KYC) process. This involves submitting a valid ID, a masked
                photo of your payment method (showing only the first six and
                last four digits), and, when needed, proof of address.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Deposit &amp; Wagering Rule</strong>: To unlock
                payouts, users must make at least one deposit and wager that
                amount at least once before submitting a withdrawal request.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fat Pirate withdrawal limit:</strong> The current
                withdrawal limit per transaction is €2,500-€5000. Larger
                amounts may be split across multiple payments depending on
                your account tier and internal security checks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Processing Times</strong>: KYC documents are usually
                reviewed within up to three business days. Overall withdrawal
                time may vary slightly based on the chosen method and how
                quickly verification is completed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>One Withdrawal at a Time</strong>: You can only have
                one active withdrawal at any moment. A new request may be
                submitted once the current one has been fully processed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Same Method Policy</strong>: Withdrawals must be made
                using the same payment method used for deposits. Any changes
                must be reported and verified before the payout can proceed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Anti-Fraud Measures</strong>: Any attempt to submit
                fake documents, abuse bonuses, operate duplicate accounts, or
                use automated tools will result in account suspension and loss
                of winnings.
